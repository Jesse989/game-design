## About

Predict the success of a game before investing time on development.

Predictions are created using Machine Learning models trained on data gathered from various sources.

Success is based on the metacritic score as there is no reliable way to find the monetery success of most of the games.

## Data

Dataset is hosted on kaggle at:
